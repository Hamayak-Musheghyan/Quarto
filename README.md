How to Play

Setup

Game Board: Set up the 4x4 game board.

Pieces: There are 16 unique pieces, each with four different characteristics: color, height, shape, and form. No two pieces are identical.


Gameplay

Turns: Players take turns placing pieces on the board.

Piece Selection: On each turn, a player selects a piece from the available pool of pieces.

Placement: The selected piece is placed on an empty space on the board.

Objective: The goal is to create a line of four pieces that share a common characteristic. This can be done horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Winning: The first player to create such a line wins the game.


Special Figures

Jokers: There are two special figures known as "jokers" - one regular joker and one super joker. These jokers can match any characteristic, making them versatile pieces for creating winning lines.

AntiJokers: Similarly, there are two "antijokers" - one regular antijoker and one super antijoker. These antijokers cannot match any characteristic, providing a strategic challenge when selecting pieces.

Super Joker and Super AntiJoker: These figures have additional properties beyond regular jokers and antijokers, adding complexity and excitement to the game.


End of Game

The game ends when one player successfully creates a line of four pieces with a common characteristic.

If all spaces on the board are filled without a winning line, the game ends in a draw.
